# The Hacking Project - Front


## :mag: The content
In these exercises, I had to do **some front work**, including:
* A navbar
* A card
* A button
* An avatar
* and a banner


**The live version : http://cursusio.herokuapp.com/**

**After cloning the repository, make sure to do :**
```sh
$ cd thp_cursusiofront
$ bundle install
```

This will install all the dependencies needed for the exercises.
